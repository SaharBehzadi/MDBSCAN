# MDBSCAN

Nowadays many applications generate mixed data objects consisting of numerical and categorical attributes. Simultaneously dealing with mixed objects is more challenging and various approaches convert one type to another one to face this issue. But in many cases this leads to information loss. Therefore integrating categorical and numerical attributes sounds reasonable since it keeps the original format of any attribute. In this paper we focus on clustering and especially density-based clustering as one of the well-known clustering approaches well-performed on arbitrary shape clusters. Density-based clustering algorithms require a distance measure to discover dense regions. Therefore we introduce the distance hierarchy as a distance measure appropriate for both categorical and numerical attributes. However setting the parameters regarding any parametric clustering algorithm could be another issue. Therefore we employ minimum description length principle to automate this process.
